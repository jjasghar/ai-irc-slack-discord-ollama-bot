## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### üö® For Critical Security Issues

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please email us directly at: **[maintainer-email@example.com]**

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Any suggested fixes (if you have them)

### üìã What to Include

When reporting a security issue, please provide:

1. **Clear description** of the vulnerability
2. **Reproduction steps** with minimal test case
3. **Impact assessment** - what could an attacker do?
4. **Affected versions** - which versions are vulnerable?
5. **Environment details** - OS, Python version, platform
6. **Proof of concept** - code or screenshots if applicable

### ‚è±Ô∏è Response Timeline

- **Initial response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution target**: Within 30 days (critical issues prioritized)

### üîí Security Best Practices

When using this bot:

#### Token Security
- **Never commit tokens** to version control
- **Use environment variables** or secure config files
- **Rotate tokens regularly** (especially if compromised)
- **Limit token permissions** to minimum required

#### Network Security
- **Use HTTPS/WSS** connections when possible
- **Configure firewalls** to restrict access to Ollama
- **Monitor bot activity** for suspicious behavior
- **Keep dependencies updated** regularly

#### Data Privacy
- **AI processing is local** - no data sent to external services
- **Monitor conversation logs** for sensitive information
- **Consider data retention policies** for stored responses
- **Be aware of platform logging** (Discord, Slack, IRC logs)

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

This bot includes several security measures:

- **Input validation** on all user messages
- **Error handling** to prevent information disclosure
- **Local AI processing** - no external API calls for AI
- **Token isolation** in configuration files
- **Event deduplication** to prevent replay attacks

### üìä Threat Model

Potential security considerations:

#### High Risk
- **Token compromise** - Could allow unauthorized bot control
- **Code injection** - Malicious messages processed by AI
- **Network interception** - Tokens or messages in transit

#### Medium Risk
- **Information disclosure** - Bot revealing sensitive data
- **Resource exhaustion** - DoS through excessive requests
- **AI prompt injection** - Manipulating AI responses

#### Low Risk
- **Social engineering** - Users tricked by AI responses
- **Data persistence** - Conversation history storage

### üîÑ Security Updates

- Security patches are released as soon as possible
- Critical vulnerabilities get immediate patches
- All users are notified via GitHub releases
- Update instructions provided in release notes

### üèÜ Recognition

We appreciate security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities. Contributors will be:

- Credited in release notes (unless they prefer anonymity)
- Listed in our security acknowledgments
- Provided with early access to fixes for verification
